The Memphis Police Department has disbanded a specialized group known as the Scorpion unit after five of its officers were charged with second-degree murder in the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was shown on video being kicked, struck and pepper-sprayed by those officers.
The unit had been central to efforts by city and police officials to combat persistent violence and crime at a time when the city’s murder rate had been climbing, stoking fears about public safety.
 Mayor of Memphis Jim Strickland had highlighted the unit’s importance to his crime-fighting strategy during his State of the City address a year ago.
